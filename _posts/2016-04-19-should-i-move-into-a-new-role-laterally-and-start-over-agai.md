How many times have you asked that question to your manager. Every time I came across a situation like that I asked myself, 'What do you want to do with your life (or career)?

"Should I move into a new role laterally and start over again or wait in this role to get promoted?" sounds familiar? I heard this question for the third time in the last 2 months. How many times have you asked that question to your manager. Every time I came across a situation like that I asked myself, 'What do you want to do with your life (or career)? Do you want to be a deep sea diver or a long distance swimmer?" While the decision is different for each individual, here are some points to think about -

1. _Build depth in one area_- Whatever career you chose, make sure that you have one bedrock skill/competency or area of expertise that you will be a master at.This could be a life saver in the long run. If it is Talent Acquisition, then ensure that you have understood every aspect of it, right from manpower planning, financial budgeting to system solutions. For this you may have to do couple of rotations in TA functions itself. 
2. _Look __In __or Look __Out_- Once you are confident of developing confidence in that One area of expertise. Look around and see what makes sense as the next step. Start with upstream and downstream processes, look for areas where you can leverage your expertise within your own function. I am not suggesting looking out of your organization, I mean looking outside your core area of expertise. Because whichever path you choose there will be learning and challenges.
3. _Be General_- When you move from managing your performance to managing performance of others, one important aspect is to build a wider view of the world around you. More often than not the team looks up at their leader to not only help them decipher their immediate challenges, but other factors impacting their goals in the long run. Some steps for you to help and grow in this area - Build your network with leaders in the organization, understand industry trends, learn about finance and HR, understand implications of talent and finance on your organization. I am not talking anything about your domain or results in that area, that to me is a given. One source of great insights of being general or demonstrating common sense is[Bud Bilianich - The Common Sense Guy][0]do spend some time reading him._Play on your strengths_- Lastly, by this time you would have anchored your career. Whether it is industry (Retail, Telecom, Aerospace) , skill (Java, Pay and Benefits) or function (HR, Finance, IT) is not the point but be sure you have the anchor in place. This is the time to go swim and swim real long distances. This is where you leadership comes to play and not so much the domain. Your strengths should be what you must play on, if you are the leader who can be a change leader, go jump into roles that give you an opportunity to play on that. Don't bother if you have been the Finance expert and the next role for you is the CIO, rather ask for such challenges.

Success is relative, so there is never a right or wrong. Both the options can be followed to be successful. At the end of the day it is important to smile.

Create Happiness.
